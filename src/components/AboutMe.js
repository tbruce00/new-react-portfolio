                Upstate New York native turned Colorado transplant. A graduate of SUNY Brockport with a bachelor's degree in Media Production/Film Studies. 
                Spent most of my working life in the IT field and took on the coding bootcamp program in search of a change, to realize a passion, with the intention of becoming proficient in programming languages and frameworks. Specializing in React, my goal is in translating the teachings from the bootcamp into a career as a Full Stack Web Developer!

                In my free time I enjoy spending time in the dichotomy of natural wonders and urban landscapes. I enjoy backpacking trips with friends and exploring the surroundings of my city. As well as a good film or book on less adventurous evenings.
